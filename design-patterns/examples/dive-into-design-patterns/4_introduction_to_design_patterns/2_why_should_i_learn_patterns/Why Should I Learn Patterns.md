## Why should I learn patterns? 为什么要学设计模式?
The truth is that you might manage to work as a programmer for many years without knowing about a single pattern. 
A lot of people do just that. Even in that case, though, you might be implementing some patterns without even knowing 
it. So why would you spend time learning them?
- Design patterns are a toolkit of **tried and tested solutions** to common problems in software design. Even if you 
never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of 
problems using principles of object-oriented design.
- Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently. You 
can say, "Oh, just use a Singleton for that," and everyone will understand the idea behind your suggestion. No need 
to explain what a singleton is if you know the pattern and its name.

译: 也许你已经从事程序开发工作多年了，但却完全不知道单例模式是什么。很多人都是这样。即便如此，你可能也在不自知的情况下已经使用过一些设计模式了。
所以为什么要花时间来学习它们呢?
- 设计模式是针对软件设计中常见问题的工具箱，其中的工具就是各种**经过实践验证的解决方案**。即使你从未遇到过这些问题，了解设计模式仍然是非常有用的，
因为它能指导你如何使用面向对象的设计原则来解决各种问题。
- 设计模式定义了一种能让你和团队成员更加高效沟通的通用语言。你只需说"哦，这里用单例就可以了"，那么所有人就会理解这条建议背后的想法。只要知晓模式
及其名称，你就无需解释什么是单例了。
