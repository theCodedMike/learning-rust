## SOLID Principles SOLID原则

Now that you know the basic design principles, let's take a look at five that are commonly known as the SOLID 
principles. Robert Martin introduced them in the book [*Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices*][Agile Software Development].   
译: 现在相信你已经了解了基本的设计原则，那就让我们来看看名为SOLID的五条原则吧。这五条原则是在罗伯特·马丁的著作[《敏捷软件开发: 原则、模式与实践》][敏捷软件开发]
中首次提出的。

*SOLID* is a mnemonic for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and
maintainable.   
译: SOLID是让软件设计更易于理解、更加灵活和更易于维护的五个原则的简称。

As with everything in life, using these principles mindlessly can cause more harm than good. The cost of applying these
principles into a program's architecture might be making it more complicated than it should be. I doubt that there's a 
successful software product in which all of these principles are applied at the same time. Striving for these 
principles is good, but always try to be pragmatic and don't take everything written here as dogma.   
译: 与生活中所有事情一样，盲目遵守这些原则可能会弊大于利。在应用架构中使用这些原则可能会使其变得过于复杂。对于能同时应用这五条原则而开发出成功
的软件产品，我表示怀疑。有原则是件好事，但是也要时刻从实用的角度来考量，不要把这里的每句话当作放之四海皆准的教条。
