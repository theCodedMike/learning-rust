## Design Principles 设计原则
What is good software design? How would you measure it? What practices would you need to follow to achieve it? How
can you make your architecture flexible, stable and easy to understand?   
译: 什么是优秀的软件设计呢? 如何对其进行评估? 要实现它你需要遵循哪些实践原则呢? 如何让你的架构保持灵活性、稳定性且易于理解? 

These are the great questions; but, unfortunately, the answers are different depending on the type of application 
you're building. Nevertheless, there are several universal principles of software design that might help you answer 
these questions for your own project. Most of the design patterns listed in this book are based on these principles.

这些问题有所帮助。本书列出的绝大部分设计模式都是基于这些原则的。
