# Factory Method

**Factory method** is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without 
specifying their concrete classes.

The Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct constructor 
call (`new` operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.

> If you can't figure out the difference between various factory patterns and concepts, then read our [**Factory Comparison**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-comparison).



## Dialog Rendering
This example illustrates how to organize a GUI framework into independent modules using **dynamic dispatch**:
1. The `gui` module defines interfaces for all the components. It has no external dependencies.
2. The `html_gui` module provides HTML implementation of the base GUI. Depends on `gui`.
3. The `windows_gui` module provides Windows implementation of the base GUI. Depends on `gui`.

The `app` is a client application that can use several implementations of the GUI framework, depending on the current 
environment or configuration. However, most of the app code doesnâ€™t depend on specific types of GUI elements. All 
client code works with GUI elements through abstract interfaces defined by the `gui` module.

The [**Abstract Factory**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory/rust/example) example demonstrates 
an even greater separation of a factory interface and its implementations.

### How to Run

```bash
cargo run --example factory-method-render-dialog
```

### Output

```
-- No OS detected, creating the HTML GUI --
<button>Test Button</button>
Click! Button says - 'Hello World!'
Dialog - Refresh
```



## Maze Game
This example illustrates how to implement the Factory Method pattern using **static dispatch** (generics).

*Inspired by the Factory Method [**example from the GoF book**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern).*

### How to Run

```bash
cargo run --example factory-method-maze-game
```

### Output

```
Loading resources...
Starting the game...
Magic Room: Infinite Room
Magic Room: Red Room
Loading resources...
Starting the game...
Ordinary Room: #2
Ordinary Room: #1
```
