# Iterator
**Iterator** is a behavioral design pattern that allows sequential traversal through a complex data structure without 
exposing its internal details.

Thanks to the Iterator, clients can go over elements of different collections in a similar fashion using a single 
iterator interface.


## Standard Iterator
Iterators are heavily used in idiomatic ðŸ¦€ Rust code. This is how to use iterators over a standard array collection.

```rust
let array = &[1, 2, 3];
let iterator = array.iter();

// Traversal over each element of the vector.
iterator.for_each(|e| print!("{}, ", e));
```


## Custom Iterator
In Rust, the recommended way to define your *custom* iterator is to use a standard `Iterator` trait. The example 
doesn't contain a synthetic iterator interface, because it is really recommended to use the idiomatic Rust way.

```rust
let users = UserCollection::new();
let mut iterator = users.iter();

iterator.next();
```

A `next` method is the only `Iterator` trait method which is mandatory to be implemented. It makes accessible a huge 
range of standard methods, e.g. `fold`, `map`, `for_each`.

```rust
impl Iterator for UserIterator<'_> {
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
```

## How to Run

```bash
cargo run --example iterator
```

## Output

```
Iterators are widely used in the standard library: 1 2 3

Let's test our own iterator.

1st element: Some("Alice")
2nd element: Some("Bob")
3rd element: Some("Carl")
4th element: None


All elements in user collection: Alice Bob Carl
```
